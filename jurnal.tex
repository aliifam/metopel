\title{\textbf{Docker for Accelerating Development and Deployment in Software Development Life Cycle}}
\author{Alif Arief Maulana}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. Containers are created from images that specify their precise contents. Images are often created by combining and modifying standard images downloaded from public repositories. Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers.
